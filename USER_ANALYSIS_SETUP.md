# User Analysis Feature Setup Guide

## Overview
This feature provides AI-powered analysis of student college preferences and admission chances using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

## Setup Requirements

### 1. OpenAI API Key
You need to add your OpenAI API key to the `.local.env` file:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 2. Dependencies
The backend now requires the `openai` package, which has been installed.

## Features

### 1. General Description
- Analyzes the types of schools the student has liked
- Identifies patterns (selective, party schools, sports-focused, small schools, etc.)
- Provides a brief 2-3 sentence overview

### 2. College Preferences Analysis
- Identifies common themes among liked schools
- Highlights what the student values most
- Shows unique factors that make each school distinct

### 3. Admission Chances Assessment
- Classifies each liked college as:
  - **REACH**: Very competitive, low chance
  - **TARGET**: Good match, moderate chance
  - **LIKELY**: Strong candidate, high chance
  - **SAFETY**: Very likely to get in
- Based on student's test scores vs. college's 50th percentile scores

## API Endpoint

### GET `/me/analysis`
- **Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)
- **Response**: JSON with three sections:
  ```json
  {
    "general_description": "Brief overview of preferences",
    "college_preferences": "Analysis of what they value",
    "admission_chances": [
      {
        "college_name": "University Name",
        "assessment": "REACH - Your SAT scores are below the 25th percentile"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Frontend Integration

### Navigation
- Added "ðŸ§  Analysis" link in the top navigation bar
- Route: `/analysis`
- Protected by AuthGuard

### UI Components
- Loading states with spinner
- Error handling for API failures
- Color-coded admission chance classifications
- Responsive design using existing CSS system

## Testing

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Sign in to the application
2. Like some colleges using the swipe interface
3. Navigate to "ðŸ§  Analysis" in the top bar
4. View your personalized college analysis

## Error Handling

- **503 Error**: OpenAI API not configured
- **401 Error**: Authentication required
- **404 Error**: User profile not found
- **500 Error**: Analysis processing failed

## Customization

### Prompt Engineering
The OpenAI prompt can be customized in `backend/app/main.py` around line 650. The current prompt:
- Provides clear structure for the three analysis sections
- Includes student profile and college data
- Requests specific formatting for admission chances
- Limits response to 800 tokens for cost efficiency

### Model Selection
Currently uses GPT-4, but can be changed to other models by modifying the `model` parameter in the OpenAI API call.

## Cost Considerations

- Each analysis request costs approximately $0.02-0.05 depending on response length
- Consider implementing caching for repeated requests
- Monitor API usage in your OpenAI dashboard

## Security Notes

- API key is stored in environment variables
- All requests require valid JWT authentication
- User data is only accessible to authenticated users
- No sensitive data is sent to OpenAI beyond what's necessary for analysis
